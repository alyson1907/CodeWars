## About CodeWars
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a gamified platform where developers achieve code mastery through challenges called **kata**.

These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

On Codewars, users earn ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and for quality solutions.

## About Kyu
**Kyu's** are the difficulty/level of the katas. They go from **8 Kyu** (containing the easiest katas) to **1 Kyu** (hardest katas)
